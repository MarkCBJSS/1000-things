# What?
JavaSxcripty Things is a repository of (eventually) 1000 things I'll have created using / with / including JavaScript. They may be complex, they may be simple, they may be good bad or ugly, but they shall be things ;}

# Why?
The point is to practice, practice, practice. Get the 10,000 hours in. The only way to Get Good is to make 1000 things and make mistakes, etc.

# How?
The plan is to study a range of courses and tutorials, which I'll list at the bottom of this Readme, then build things. Those things might be simple classes or objects, arrays and case statements, they might be small utilities or features that could be added to something bigger, they might even be the big things themselves. We'll see how this goes.

# When?
Whenever I can over the coming months. If I did 1 thing per day (which I won't...) then building 1000 things will take 2.7 years - so settle in...

# Contributing
If there's anything that you think could be improved due to misunderstanding, then let me know.
